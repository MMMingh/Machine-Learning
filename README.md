"Screening of peptide drug for the cancer-associated target"

Project Description:

Analysing the peptide sequence data and their affinity to both wildtype and cancer-associated mutants, machine learning method is applied to evaluate the binding preference, perform clustering analysis to explore the sequential similarity among peptides that have higher binding efficiency, find out and visualise the conserved amino acid residues. 

The project leverages feature vectors derived by using the ESM2 (Evolutionary Scale Modelling 2) from peptide amino acid sequences, employing these vectors as inputs for classification and clustering tasks to enhance model prediction capabilities and accuracy. 

The output from this project helps with completing the wet and dry loop and provides a more refined direction of drug discovery, reducing experimental costs and improving the efficiency and speed of drug development. 

Here, demo examples are provided to demonstrate the workflow code, research figures and outcomes.
